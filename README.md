# About

This is a terraform module that provisions a postgres server that is part of a patroni high availability cluster. Depending on the input values passed, replication can be either synchronous (strict or not) or asynchronous. See the patroni documentation for the tradeoffs between the replication modes.

Given that it is the common denominator for all the clients we are using, only password authentication is supported for now. The module will take a password as an argument for its superuser account.

# Libvirt Networking Support

This module supports both libvirt networks and direct macvtap connection (bridge mode).

# Usage

## Variables

This module takes the following variables as input:

- **name**: Name to give to the vm. Will be the hostname as well.
- **vcpus**: Number of vcpus to assign to the vm. Defaults to 2.
- **memory**: Amount of memory in MiB to assign to the vm. Defaults to 8192.
- **volume_id**: Id of the image volume to attach to the vm. A recent version of ubuntu is recommended as this is what this module has been validated against.
- **data_volume_id**: Id for an optional separate disk volume to attach to the vm on postgres' data path
- **libvirt_network**: Parameters to connect to libvirt networks. Note that only the first interface in the list (libvirt network and macvtap) will be used to advertise the patroni rest api. Each entry has the following keys:
  - **network_id**: Id (ie, uuid) of the libvirt network to connect to (in which case **network_name** should be an empty string).
  - **network_name**: Name of the libvirt network to connect to (in which case **network_id** should be an empty string).
  - **ip**: Ip of interface connecting to the libvirt network.
  - **mac**: Mac address of interface connecting to the libvirt network.
  - **prefix_length**:  Length of the network prefix for the network the interface will be connected to. For a **192.168.1.0/24** for example, this would be **24**.
  - **gateway**: Ip of the network's gateway. Usually the gateway the first assignable address of a libvirt's network.
  - **dns_servers**: Dns servers to use. Usually the dns server is first assignable address of a libvirt's network.
- **macvtap_interfaces**: List of macvtap interfaces to connect the vm to if you opt for macvtap interfaces. Note that only the first interface in the list (libvirt network and macvtap) will be used to advertise the patroni rest api. Each entry in the list is a map with the following keys:
  - **interface**: Host network interface that you plan to connect your macvtap interface with.
  - **prefix_length**: Length of the network prefix for the network the interface will be connected to. For a **192.168.1.0/24** for example, this would be 24.
  - **ip**: Ip associated with the macvtap interface. 
  - **mac**: Mac address associated with the macvtap interface
  - **gateway**: Ip of the network's gateway for the network the interface will be connected to.
  - **dns_servers**: Dns servers for the network the interface will be connected to. If there aren't dns servers setup for the network your vm will connect to, the ip of external dns servers accessible accessible from the network will work as well.

## Gotchas

### Macvtap and Host Traffic

Because of the way macvtap is setup in bridge mode, traffic from the host to the guest vm is not possible. However, traffic from other guest vms on the host or from other physical hosts on the network will work fine.

### Volume Pools, Ubuntu and Apparmor

At the time of this writing, libvirt will not set the apparmor permission of volume pools properly on recent versions of ubuntu. This will result in volumes that cannot be attached to your vms (you will get a permission error).

You need to setup the permissions in apparmor yourself for it to work.

See the following links for the bug and workaround:

- https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libvirt/+bug/1677398
- https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libvirt/+bug/1677398/comments/43

### Requisite Outgoing Traffic

Note that because cloud-init installs external dependencies, you will need working dns that can resolve names on the internet and outside connectivity for the vm.
